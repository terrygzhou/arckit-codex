description: "Phase D — Technology Architecture: infrastructure, platform, network, deployment, integration architecture"
---

You are helping an enterprise architect create a **Technology Architecture** document for Phase D of the TOGAF Architecture Development Method (ADM). This document defines the infrastructure, platform, network, deployment, and integration architecture that supports the target enterprise architecture.

## User Input

```text
$ARGUMENTS
```

## Prerequisites: Read Foundational Artifacts

> **Note**: Before generating, scan `projects/` for existing project directories. For each project, list all `ARC-*.md` artifacts, check `external/` for reference documents, and check `000-global/` for cross-project policies. If no external docs exist but they would improve output, ask the user.

**MANDATORY** (stop if missing — generate upstream artefact first):

- **APP** (Application Inventory) — Extract: Application portfolio, existing technology stack, hosting models, infrastructure dependencies
  - If missing: STOP and ask user to run `/arckit:application-inventory` first. Technology architecture requires understanding of existing technology assets.
- **DATA** (Data Architecture) — Extract: Data platform requirements, storage needs, data processing requirements, data security classifications
  - If missing: STOP and ask user to run `/arckit:data-architecture` first. Technology architecture must support data architecture requirements.
- **PRIN** (Architecture Principles, in 000-global) — Extract: Technology standards, approved technology stack, prohibited technologies, cloud strategy
  - If missing: STOP and ask user to run `/arckit:principles` first. Technology architecture must be grounded in enterprise principles.

**RECOMMENDED** (read if available, note if missing):

- **ADMP** (Architecture Vision / Preliminary ADM) — Extract: Scope boundaries, strategic vision, success criteria
- **STRAT** (Architecture Strategy) — Extract: Strategic themes, investment priorities, technology modernisation roadmap
- **BPCM** (Business Capability Map) — Extract: Capabilities requiring technology support, performance requirements, availability requirements

### Prerequisites 1b: Read external documents and policies

- Read any **external documents** listed in the project context (`external/` files) — extract existing technology landscape assessments, infrastructure inventories, network diagrams, cloud strategy documents
- Read any **enterprise standards** in `projects/000-global/external/` — extract technology standards, procurement policies, security baselines, approved vendor lists
- If no external technology docs found but they would improve the output, ask: "Do you have any existing technology landscape assessments, infrastructure inventories, or cloud strategy documents? I can read PDFs, spreadsheets, and images directly. Place them in `projects/{project-dir}/external/` and re-run, or skip."
- **Citation traceability**: When referencing content from external documents, follow the citation instructions in `.arckit/references/citation-instructions.md`. Place inline citation markers (e.g., `[TA-C1]`) next to findings informed by source documents and populate the "External References" section in the template.

## Instructions

### 1. Identify or Create Project

Identify the target project from the hook context. If the user specifies a project that doesn't exist yet, create a new project:

1. Use Glob to list `projects/*/` directories and find the highest `NNN-*` number (or start at `001` if none exist)
2. Calculate the next number (zero-padded to 3 digits, e.g., `002`)
3. Slugify the project name (lowercase, replace non-alphanumeric with hyphens, trim)
4. Use the Write tool to create `projects/{NNN}-{slug}/README.md` with the project name, ID, and date — the Write tool will create all parent directories automatically
5. Also create `projects/{NNN}-{slug}/external/README.md` with a note to place external reference documents here
6. Set `PROJECT_ID` = the 3-digit number, `PROJECT_PATH` = the new directory path

### 2. Read Technology Architecture Template

**Run the intake interview**:

- Run the intake interview per `.arckit/references/intake-instructions.md` — derive required inputs from the effective template and MANDATORY prerequisites, prefill from existing sources, put **every** intake question to the user one at a time (**ask-always, answer-optional** — the interview must ask; each answer is optional and may be skipped, rendering as a `TBD` marker when skipped), and persist the answers. A previously saved or prefilled answer never waives the interview — on a re-run, a saved `.arckit/intake/` file only prefills the questions, so every question is still put to the user, one at a time, to confirm, override, or skip. Never collapse the interview into a single batch-confirmation question: each question is its own turn, even when fully prefilled; if no structured question tool is available, ask each question in plain text.

**Read the template** (with user override support):

- **First**, check if `.arckit/templates-custom/tech-architecture-template.md` exists in the project root
- **If found**: Read the user's customised template (user override takes precedence)
- **If not found**: Read `.arckit/templates/tech-architecture-template.md` (default)

> **Tip**: Users can customise templates with `/arckit:customize technology-architecture`

### 3. Generate Technology Architecture Document

Create the Technology Architecture document following the template structure. Populate all sections with content derived from the available artifacts.

## Important Notes

1. **Evidence-Based Technology Selection**: This document must be grounded in existing application inventory (APP) and data architecture (DATA). Do not invent technology stacks without evidence from source artifacts.

2. **Standards Drive Consistency**: Technology standards are the mechanism that prevents technology sprawl. Define approved stacks early and reference them in all downstream decisions.

3. **Use Write Tool**: The technology architecture document is typically 250-400 lines. ALWAYS use the Write tool to create it. Never output the full content in chat.

4. **Mandatory Prerequisites**: APP and DATA are mandatory prerequisites. Technology architecture without understanding of existing applications and data requirements is disconnected from reality. PRIN is mandatory for principle alignment.

5. **Deployment Drives Resilience**: High availability and disaster recovery are not afterthoughts — they must be designed into the deployment architecture from the start. Define RTO/RPO targets explicitly.

6. **Traceability is Critical**: Every technology decision must trace back to source documents. This ensures the technology architecture is grounded in business needs, not technology preference.

7. **Integration with Other Commands**:
   - **Input**: Requires APP (technology baseline), DATA (data platform requirements), PRIN (technology principles)
   - **Output**: Feeds `/arckit:gap-analysis` (current vs. target gaps), `/arckit:transition-architecture` (migration planning)

8. **Version Management**: If a technology architecture document already exists (`ARC-*-TECH-v*.md`), create a new version (v2.0) rather than overwriting. Track technology architecture evolution across ADM cycles.

9. **TOGAF Alignment**: This document maps to TOGAF ADM Phase D (Technology Architecture) outputs: Technology infrastructure, platform services, integration technology, deployment topology, and technology standards.

10. **Markdown escaping**: When writing less-than or greater-than comparisons, always include a space after `<` or `>` (e.g., `< 3 seconds`, `> 99.9% uptime`) to prevent markdown renderers from interpreting them as HTML tags or emoji

## PlantUML ArchiMate View (additive)

When the artefact content is **ArchiMate-representable** (a layer/tier, capability, service, application or technology component, or a motivation element — driver/goal/constraint), add a PlantUML-ArchiMate view to the generated artefact:

1. Load `.arckit/skills/plantuml-syntax/references/archimate.md` (pinned `!include <archimate/Archimate>`, PlantUML 1.2026.8) for notation.
2. Fill the `## PlantUML ArchiMate View` block in the template, stereotyped into the **Technology** layer focus.
3. Quality gates: single-layer stereotyping; ≤ 12 elements per layer; realization edges point concrete → abstract; no unlabelled cross-layer edges.

This is additive — the existing Mermaid diagram(s) are retained, not replaced.

## PlantUML ArchiMate Companion View (Physical, additive)

When the artefact content supports a **Physical** companion view, add a **separate** PlantUML-ArchiMate companion view to the generated artefact (a separate sequenced `ARCH` document, not merged into the base view above):

1. Load `.arckit/skills/plantuml-syntax/references/archimate.md` (pinned `!include <archimate/Archimate>`, PlantUML 1.2026.8) for notation.
2. Fill the `### PlantUML ArchiMate Companion View (Physical)` block in the `technology-architecture` template (`{companion_physical_elements}`, `{companion_physical_relationships}`, `{companion_physical_layout}`).
3. Quality gates: separate `ARCH` document; ≤ 12 elements per layer; realization edges point concrete → abstract; split-never-drop (reduce to the most material elements or split into another `ARCH` doc, never silently drop).

This is additive — the demanded base view and existing Mermaid diagram(s) are retained, not replaced.

## Render the ArchiMate view(s) to self-contained SVG(s)

PlantUML does not render in GitHub markdown, so each ArchiMate view above (the demanded base view, and any companion view) is delivered as a rendered **self-contained `.svg`** — the inline PlantUML source above stays the source of truth:

1. Render offline with the pinned build: `java -jar plantuml-1.2026.8.jar -tsvg <view>.puml` (no public server, no URL-include path).
2. The rendered `.svg` is the **only new rendered file** for the view; do not create a new architecture document file to host the view (the inline PlantUML source is retained).
3. Verify self-containment before delivery: no `http(s)` URL other than the W3C `2000/svg` / `1999/xlink` namespace declarations, `xlink:href` limited to local `#anchors`, and the SVG opens and renders fully offline.
4. Notation + rendering reference: § Diagram Production Policy + § Offline Self-Contained SVG Rendering in `skills/plantuml-syntax/references/archimate.md`.

## Suggested Next Steps

After completing this command, consider running:

- `/arckit:gap-analysis` -- Analyze gaps between current and target technology architecture
- `/arckit:transition-architecture` -- Plan migration from current to target technology state
