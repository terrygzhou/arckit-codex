# Technology Architecture — TOGAF ADM Phase D

## Intake Interview Questions

The template-driven intake interview asks the questions below before rendering this
artefact. Every question below is always put to the user for their input, one
question at a time, and is prefilled where answerable from existing artefacts,
saved intake, onboarding data, or organisation config so the user can confirm or
override it. Each question is **optional**: a skipped question renders as a
`TBD` marker in the artefact. Sources: TOGAF Standard, 10th Edition
(discovery dimensions per ADM phase) and the O-AA / agentic outcome dimensions below.

### Intake questions (TOGAF 10 — ADM Phase D)

- **Current infrastructure:** What infrastructure, platforms, and hosting environments run today (cloud/on-prem/hybrid)?
- **Target topology:** What is the target technology topology (cloud model, regions, runtimes), and why?
- **Standards:** Which technology standards and platform rules must the design follow?
- **Constraints:** What vendor, licensing, latency, jurisdiction, or budget constraints apply?
- **Risk:** Where are the key technical risks (lock-in, performance, security, capacity)?
