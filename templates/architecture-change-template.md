# Architecture Change Request

## Intake Interview Questions

The template-driven intake interview asks the questions below before rendering this
artefact. Every question below is always put to the user for their input, one
question at a time, and is prefilled where answerable from existing artefacts,
saved intake, onboarding data, or organisation config so the user can confirm or
override it. Each question is **optional**: a skipped question renders as a
`TBD` marker in the artefact. Sources: TOGAF Standard, 10th Edition
(discovery dimensions per ADM phase) and the O-AA / agentic outcome dimensions below.

### Intake questions (TOGAF 10 — change governance)

- **Change:** What exactly changes (capability, application, data asset, platform), and why?
- **Impact:** Which stakeholders, services, and artefacts are affected, and how?
- **Risk:** What is the risk of change, and what is the risk of doing nothing?
- **Approver:** Who is accountable for approving this change?
- **Reversibility:** Is the change reversible, and what is the rollback plan?
- **Change type:** What type of architecture change is this? Options: `Evolutionary` | `Transformational` | `Corrective` (default: `Evolutionary`):
  - **Evolutionary**: Incremental improvement to existing architecture — extends or enhances current capabilities without fundamental change
  - **Transformational**: Fundamental change that restructures significant portions of the architecture — new capabilities, technology platforms, or operating models
  - **Corrective**: Fix for architectural deficiencies, technical debt, or compliance failures — restores intended design
- **Priority:** What is the priority level of this change? Options: `Critical` | `High` | `Medium` | `Low` (default: `Medium`):
  - **Critical**: Must be implemented immediately — safety, security, or regulatory compliance
  - **High**: Major business impact — core capability changes, significant investment
  - **Medium**: Standard change — enhancement or improvement within planned cycles
  - **Low**: Minor refinement — low-risk, low-cost improvements
- **ADM Re-Entry:** Which ADM phases need to be re-entered for this change? (multi-select; skip if none)
  - **Phase A (Architecture Vision)**: Change affects overall vision or scope
  - **Phase B (Business Architecture)**: Change affects business processes or organisation
  - **Phase C (Information Systems)**: Change affects data or application architecture
  - **Phase D (Technology Architecture)**: Change affects technology infrastructure
  - **Phase E (Opportunities & Solutions)**: Change affects solution options or migrations
  - **Phase F (Migration Planning)**: Change affects migration sequencing
  - **Phase G (Implementation Governance)**: Change affects implementation oversight
  - **Phase H (Change Management)**: Change affects ongoing change control

> This view is additive; the Mermaid diagram(s) above are unchanged.

- **CLI**: `java -jar plantuml.jar <file>.puml`
- **Public server**: https://www.plantuml.com/plantuml/uml/ (keep the view small; never inline the stdlib into the URL source)
- **Notation reference**: `skills/plantuml-syntax/references/archimate.md`
- **Artefact delivery**: the view is shipped as a rendered **self-contained `.svg`** (offline, pinned build `plantuml-1.2026.8.jar -tsvg`; no external URLs, fully offline-openable); the inline PlantUML source above is retained as the source of truth.
