description: "Perform gap analysis — capability matrix, gap severity scoring, workstream mapping"
---

You are helping an enterprise architect perform a **Gap Analysis** for TOGAF ADM Phase E (Opportunities & Solutions). This document identifies gaps between current and target architectures, scores their severity, and maps them to workstreams for prioritised delivery.

## User Input

```text
$ARGUMENTS
```

## Prerequisites: Read Architecture Artifacts

> **Note**: Before generating, scan `projects/` for existing project directories. For each project, list all `ARC-*.md` artifacts, check `external/` for reference documents, and check `000-global/` for cross-project policies. If no external docs exist but they would improve output, ask the user.

**MANDATORY** (stop if missing — generate upstream artefact first):

- **BPCM** (Business Capability Model) — Extract: Capability hierarchy, maturity levels, capability ownership, capability-to-objective mappings
  - If missing: STOP and ask user to run `/arckit:business-capability-map` first. Gap analysis requires a capability baseline.

**RECOMMENDED** (read if available, note if missing):

- **PRIN** (Architecture Principles) — Extract: Guiding principles, compliance requirements, technology standards, design constraints
  - If missing: note in assumptions that principle alignment could not be validated
- **STRAT** (Architecture Strategy) — Extract: Strategic vision, target state description, strategic themes, investment priorities
  - If missing: note in assumptions that strategic alignment could not be validated
- **PRIN** (Architecture Principles, in 000-global) — Extract: Enterprise-level principles, decision framework, governance standards
  - If missing: note in assumptions that enterprise-level principle alignment could not be validated

### Prerequisites 1b: Read external documents and policies

- Read any **external documents** listed in the project context (`external/` files) — extract baseline assessments, target architecture descriptions, migration strategies
- Read any **enterprise standards** in `projects/000-global/external/` — extract capability maturity models, technology standards, compliance frameworks
- If no external assessment docs found but they would improve the output, ask: "Do you have any existing capability assessments, target architecture descriptions, or migration plans? I can read PDFs and images directly. Place them in `projects/{project-dir}/external/` and re-run, or skip."
- **Citation traceability**: When referencing content from external documents, follow the citation instructions in `.arckit/references/citation-instructions.md`. Place inline citation markers (e.g., `[GA-C1]`) next to findings informed by source documents and populate the "External References" section in the template.

## Instructions

### 1. Identify or Create Project

Identify the target project from the hook context. If the user specifies a project that doesn't exist yet, create a new project:

1. Use Glob to list `projects/*/` directories and find the highest `NNN-*` number (or start at `001` if none exist)
2. Calculate the next number (zero-padded to 3 digits, e.g., `002`)
3. Slugify the project name (lowercase, replace non-alphanumeric with hyphens, trim)
4. Use the Write tool to create `projects/{NNN}-{slug}/README.md` with the project name, ID, and date — the Write tool will create all parent directories automatically
5. Also create `projects/{NNN}-{slug}/external/README.md` with a note to place external reference documents here
6. Set `PROJECT_ID` = the 3-digit number, `PROJECT_PATH` = the new directory path

### 2. Read Gap Analysis Template

**Run the intake interview**:

- Run the intake interview per `.arckit/references/intake-instructions.md` — derive required inputs from the effective template and MANDATORY prerequisites, prefill from existing sources, put **every** intake question to the user one at a time (**ask-always, answer-optional** — the interview must ask; each answer is optional and may be skipped, rendering as a `TBD` marker when skipped), and persist the answers. A previously saved or prefilled answer never waives the interview — on a re-run, a saved `.arckit/intake/` file only prefills the questions, so every question is still put to the user, one at a time, to confirm, override, or skip. Never collapse the interview into a single batch-confirmation question: each question is its own turn, even when fully prefilled; if no structured question tool is available, ask each question in plain text.

**Read the template** (with user override support):

- **First**, check if `.arckit/templates-custom/gap-analysis-template.md` exists in the project root
- **If found**: Read the user's customised template (user override takes precedence)
- **If not found**: Read `.arckit/templates/gap-analysis-template.md` (default)

> **Tip**: Users can customise templates with `/arckit:customize gap-analysis`

### 3. Gather Gap Analysis Context

Read all available documents identified in the Prerequisites section. Build a mental model of:

- **Current state capabilities** (from BPCM): Maturity levels, coverage, capability gaps
- **Target state** (from STRAT/ADMP): Desired maturity levels, new capabilities, retired capabilities
- **Principles** (from PRIN): Constraints on how gaps can be addressed
- **Risks** (from RISK if available): Existing risk exposure from capability gaps
- **Stakeholder priorities** (from STKE if available): Which capability areas matter most

### 4. Load Mermaid Syntax References

Read `.arckit/skills/mermaid-syntax/references/flowchart.md` and `.arckit/skills/mermaid-syntax/references/quadrantChart.md` for official Mermaid syntax — node shapes, edge labels, quadrant chart syntax, and styling options.

### 5. Generate Gap Analysis

Create a comprehensive Gap Analysis document following the template structure.

#### Document Control

- Generate Document ID: `ARC-{P}-GAPA-v1.0` (for filename: `ARC-{P}-GAPA-v1.0.md`)
- Set owner, dates, status, classification
- Review cycle: Monthly during active ADM cycle

#### 1. Capability Gap Matrix

Build a capability gap matrix comparing current state (from BPCM) against target state (from STRAT/ADMP):

- **Current maturity**: Level 1–5 (Initial → Optimised)
- **Target maturity**: Level 1–5 (Initial → Optimised)
- **Gap Size**: Derived from delta between current and target maturity
  - Small: Δ = 1 level
  - Medium: Δ = 2 levels
  - Large: Δ = 3+ levels
- **Urgency**: Based on business criticality and time sensitivity
  - Low: Not time-critical, can wait for planned cycles
  - Medium: Should be addressed within next delivery cycle
  - High: Must be addressed in immediate planning horizon
- **Severity**: Matrix score = Gap Size × Urgency (weighted per user's chosen profile)
  - Critical: Size=Large + Urgency=High
  - High: Size=Large + Urgency=Medium, or Size=Medium + Urgency=High
  - Medium: Size=Medium + Urgency=Medium, or Size=Small + Urgency=High
  - Low: Size=Small + Urgency=Medium/Low
  - Informational: Size=Small + Urgency=Low
- **Workstream**: Assign gap to a workstream (see section 3)

#### 2. Gap Heatmap

Create a Mermaid quadrant chart plotting gaps by Size (x-axis) vs Urgency (y-axis):

- **Quadrant 1 (Immediate)**: Large gap + High urgency — must address now
- **Quadrant 2 (Plan)**: Large gap + Low urgency — plan for future cycles
- **Quadrant 3 (Monitor)**: Small gap + High urgency — quick wins
- **Quadrant 4 (Low Priority)**: Small gap + Low urgency — backlog

#### 3. Workstream Mapping

Define workstreams that group related gaps:

- Each workstream addresses a coherent set of capability gaps
- Include dependencies between workstreams (some must complete before others can start)
- Estimate duration, resources, and key milestones
- Create a Mermaid flowchart showing workstream dependencies

#### 4. Gap-to-Risk Mapping

Map each gap to associated risks:

- Unmitigated capability gaps create operational, strategic, or compliance risks
- Cross-reference with existing risk register if available
- Rate impact level (Low/Medium/High/Critical)

#### 5. Assumptions & Constraints

- List assumptions made about current state (from BPCM assessment)
- List constraints that affect gap closure (budget, timeline, skills, technology)
- Note any principle compliance implications

#### 6. Traceability

- Link each capability gap back to BPCM source
- Link workstreams to strategic themes (from STRAT)
- Link gaps to principles (from PRIN) if principle compliance is affected
- Cross-reference to stakeholder drivers (from STKE)

### 6. UK Government Specifics

If the user indicates this is a UK Government project, include:

- **Financial Year Notation**: Use "FY 2024/25", "FY 2025/26" format
- **Spending Review Alignment**: Reference SR periods
- **GDS Service Standard**: Reference Discovery/Alpha/Beta/Live phases
- **TCoP (Technology Code of Practice)**: Reference 13 points for technology gaps
- **NCSC CAF**: Security maturity progression for security-related gaps
- **Cross-Government Services**: Identify reuse opportunities (GOV.UK Pay, Notify, Design System)
- **G-Cloud/DOS**: Procurement alignment for procurement-related gaps

### 7. MOD Specifics

If this is a Ministry of Defence project, include:

- **JSP 440**: Defence project management alignment for workstream planning
- **Security Clearances**: BPSS/SC/DV requirements for security capability gaps
- **IAMM**: Security maturity progression for security gaps
- **JSP 936**: AI assurance requirements for AI/ML capability gaps (if applicable)

### 8. Quality Gate

Before writing the file, read `.arckit/references/quality-checklist.md` and verify all **Common Checks** plus the **GAPA** per-type checks pass. Fix any failures before proceeding.

**GAPA-specific quality requirements**:

- Capability gap matrix contains at least 5 capabilities
- Severity scoring is present for every gap
- Gap heatmap Mermaid diagram is present
- Workstream mapping contains at least 2 workstreams
- Workstream dependency diagram is present

### 9. Write the Gap Analysis File

**IMPORTANT**: The gap analysis document will be a substantial document (typically 250-400 lines). You MUST use the Write tool to create the file, NOT output the full content in chat.

Create the file at:

```text
projects/{P}/ARC-{P}-GAPA-v1.0.md
```

Use the Write tool with the complete content following the template structure.

### 10. Show Summary to User

After writing the file, show a concise summary (NOT the full document):

```markdown

## Important Notes

1. **Evidence-Based, Not Speculative**: This command analyses gaps between documented current state (BPCM) and documented target state (STRAT/ADMP). It should NOT invent capabilities or maturity levels without source evidence.

2. **Use Write Tool**: The gap analysis document is typically 250-400 lines. ALWAYS use the Write tool to create it. Never output the full content in chat.

3. **Mandatory Prerequisites**: BPCM is the only mandatory prerequisite. Without a capability baseline, gap analysis cannot be performed. STRAT and APP are recommended for target state and principle alignment.

4. **Severity Scoring**: The severity matrix (Size × Urgency) is the core analytical engine. The user's chosen weighting profile (Balanced/Strategic-risk/Operational) determines which gaps rise to the top.

5. **Workstream Design**: Workstreams must be coherent — grouping gaps that share technology, skills, or dependencies. Avoid creating workstreams for single gaps unless they are genuinely standalone.

6. **Traceability is Critical**: Every gap, workstream, and risk must trace back to source documents. This ensures the gap analysis is grounded in evidence, not assumptions.

7. **Integration with Other Commands**:
   - Gap Analysis feeds into: `/arckit:transition-architecture` (Phase F — Migration Planning), `/arckit:architecture-board` (governance review)
   - Gap Analysis is informed by: `/arckit:business-capability-map` (BPCM), `/arckit:strategy` (STRAT), `/arckit:principles` (PRIN)

8. **Version Management**: If a gap analysis already exists (`ARC-*-GAPA-v*.md`), create a new version (v2.0) rather than overwriting. Gap analyses should be versioned to track re-assessment across ADM cycles.

9. **Gap Triage Framework**: Use the heatmap quadrants as a decision framework:
   - **Immediate**: Assign to next work package immediately
   - **Plan**: Include in 12-month planning horizon
   - **Monitor**: Review quarterly, escalate if urgency increases
   - **Low Priority**: Maintain in backlog, remove if no longer relevant

10. **Markdown escaping**: When writing less-than or greater-than comparisons, always include a space after `<` or `>` (e.g., `< 3 seconds`, `> 99.9% uptime`) to prevent markdown renderers from interpreting them as HTML tags or emoji

## PlantUML ArchiMate View (additive)

When the artefact content is **ArchiMate-representable** (a layer/tier, capability, service, application or technology component, or a motivation element — driver/goal/constraint), add a PlantUML-ArchiMate view to the generated artefact:

1. Load `.arckit/skills/plantuml-syntax/references/archimate.md` (pinned `!include <archimate/Archimate>`, PlantUML 1.2026.8) for notation.
2. Fill the `## PlantUML ArchiMate View` block in the template, stereotyped into the **Capability (target vs current)** layer focus.
3. Quality gates: single-layer stereotyping; ≤ 12 elements per layer; realization edges point concrete → abstract; no unlabelled cross-layer edges.

This is additive — the existing Mermaid diagram(s) are retained, not replaced.

## PlantUML ArchiMate Companion View (Implementation & Migration, additive)

When the artefact content supports a **Implementation & Migration** companion view, add a **separate** PlantUML-ArchiMate companion view to the generated artefact (a separate sequenced `ARCH` document, not merged into the base view above):

1. Load `.arckit/skills/plantuml-syntax/references/archimate.md` (pinned `!include <archimate/Archimate>`, PlantUML 1.2026.8) for notation.
2. Fill the `### PlantUML ArchiMate Companion View (Implementation & Migration)` block in the `gap-analysis` template (`{companion_impl_migration_elements}`, `{companion_impl_migration_relationships}`, `{companion_impl_migration_layout}`).
3. Quality gates: separate `ARCH` document; ≤ 12 elements per layer; realization edges point concrete → abstract; split-never-drop (reduce to the most material elements or split into another `ARCH` doc, never silently drop).

This is additive — the demanded base view and existing Mermaid diagram(s) are retained, not replaced.

## Render the ArchiMate view(s) to self-contained SVG(s)

PlantUML does not render in GitHub markdown, so each ArchiMate view above (the demanded base view, and any companion view) is delivered as a rendered **self-contained `.svg`** — the inline PlantUML source above stays the source of truth:

1. Render offline with the pinned build: `java -jar plantuml-1.2026.8.jar -tsvg <view>.puml` (no public server, no URL-include path).
2. The rendered `.svg` is the **only new rendered file** for the view; do not create a new architecture document file to host the view (the inline PlantUML source is retained).
3. Verify self-containment before delivery: no `http(s)` URL other than the W3C `2000/svg` / `1999/xlink` namespace declarations, `xlink:href` limited to local `#anchors`, and the SVG opens and renders fully offline.
4. Notation + rendering reference: § Diagram Production Policy + § Offline Self-Contained SVG Rendering in `skills/plantuml-syntax/references/archimate.md`.

## Suggested Next Steps

After completing this command, consider running:

- `/arckit:transition-architecture` -- Create work packages to close identified gaps
- `/arckit:architecture-board` -- Present gap analysis to Architecture Board for prioritization
